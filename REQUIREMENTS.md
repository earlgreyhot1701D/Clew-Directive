Clew Directive Requirements Specification
Version: 1.0
Date: February 12, 2026
Project: Clew Directive - AI Learning Navigator
Author: La-Shara Cordero
Tagline: "Stop following the hype. Start directing the search."

Executive Summary
Clew Directive is a free, open-source, stateless AI tool that generates personalized "Command Briefing" PDFs mapping new AI learners to verified free learning resources. No accounts, no tracking, no paywalls.
Core Mission: Democratize AI learning by curating quality free resources and matching them to individual learner profiles through intelligent agents.

  ↓
Navigator synthesizes profile → "Does this sound like you?"
  ↓
Feedback loop (1 refinement max)
  ↓
Scout verifies resources → Navigator generates learning path
  ↓
UI displays results with clickable links
  ↓
User downloads Command Briefing PDF
  ↓
Session purged (stateless)
1.2 Tech Stack

Backend: Python 3.12+ with Strands Agents SDK v1.0
Infrastructure: TypeScript CDK
PDF Engine: WeasyPrint (HTML→PDF with clickable links via Jinja2)
Local Dev: Docker Compose with mocked Bedrock

Why NOT Bedrock Knowledge Base: Requires OpenSearch Serverless (~$700/mo) - budget killer

2. The Three Agents
2.1 Scout Agent
Model: Amazon Nova Micro ($0.000035/1K tokens)
Purpose: Load and verify resources from directory.json
Responsibilities:

Load resources from S3 via KnowledgeInterface
Filter by domain ("ai-foundations" for MVP)
Optional runtime HTTP HEAD checks on URLs
Return verified active resources

Input:
python{"domain": "ai-foundations", "verify_urls": true}
Output: Array of resource dicts (50-100 resources)
Error Handling: If URL check fails → include anyway (Curator verified within last week)

2.2 Navigator Agent
Model: Claude 4 Sonnet (Strands default)
Purpose: Deep reasoning over profile and resources
Three Tasks:
Task 1: Profile Synthesis

Transform Vibe Check answers into 3-4 sentence narrative
Empathetic tone, second person
Output shown to user: "Does this sound like you?"

Task 2: Profile Refinement (1x max)

User clicks "Not quite" → provide correction
Regenerate profile incorporating feedback
2nd rejection → reset to Vibe Check

Task 3: Learning Path Generation

Match profile to 4-6 resources from Scout
Sequence from easier → harder
Respect prerequisites
Provide reasoning for each resource

Output:
python{
  "learning_path": [
    {
      "resource_id": "elements-ai-intro",
      "sequence": 1,
      "reasoning": "Perfect starting point for skeptics...",
      "estimated_hours": 30
    },
    # 4-6 total
  ],
  "total_hours": 45,
  "next_steps": "After completing these..."
}

2.3 Curator Lambda
Model: Amazon Nova Micro
Trigger: EventBridge (Sundays 2AM UTC)
Purpose: Automated weekly freshness checks
Process:

Load all resources from directory.json
HTTP HEAD check each URL
Update last_verified timestamp
Mark dead URLs as status: "inactive"
Alert if >10% fail
Write updated JSON to S3


3. Vibe Check - The 4 Questions
Q1: Skepticism
"Which best describes your current take on AI?"

Skeptical — I want to understand what's real
Curious but haven't started learning
I've dabbled and want more structure
I use AI tools already and want to go deeper

Q2: Goal
"If AI could help you with one thing, what would it be?"

Understand what AI actually is and isn't
Use AI tools to be better at my current job
Build things with AI
Make career decisions about AI

Q3: Learning Style
"How do you prefer to learn new things?"

Reading and thinking at my own pace
Watching videos with examples
Hands-on projects and exercises
Structured courses with a clear path

Q4: Context
"What's your professional context?"

Education / Academia
Business / Marketing / Operations
Technical / Engineering / IT
Creative / Design / Media
Other / Career switching

UX: Sequential (one at a time), not all-at-once

4. Command Briefing PDF
Engine: Jinja2 template + WeasyPrint
Storage: S3 with 24-hour TTL (auto-deleted)
Structure
Header:
COMMAND BRIEFING
Generated: [timestamp]
Session: [UUID]

"This briefing was generated by Clew Directive, 
a free, open-source AI learning navigator."
Section 1: Your Profile
[Navigator's 3-4 sentence summary]
Section 2: Your Learning Path
Resource 1: [Name]
Provider: [Organization]
Time: [Hours]
Format: [Type]

Why This Resource:
[Navigator's 2-3 sentence reasoning]

👉 Start Learning: [clickable URL]

---
[Repeat for 4-6 resources]
Section 3: Next Steps
[Navigator's guidance on what to do after]
Footer:
Links verified as of [date].

We don't keep your data because we don't need it.
Your briefing is yours.
Styling: Clean, professional, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

5. Directory.json - The 5-Gate Standard
Location: data/directory.json in S3
Curation: Manual (hand-picked, not scraped)
Quality Gates
Gate 1 - Authority: University / Major tech / Respected platform
Gate 2 - Truly Free: No paywalls, freemium OK if core is free
Gate 3 - Current: Updated within 18 months (or maintained classic)
Gate 4 - Pedagogically Sound: Structured, has exercises, clear objectives
Gate 5 - Accessible: No region-locks, English, self-paced
Resource Schema
json{
  "id": "elements-ai-intro",
  "name": "Introduction to AI",
  "provider": "University of Helsinki",
  "resource_url": "https://course.elementsofai.com/",
  "authority_tier": 1,
  "free_model": "fully_free",
  "category": "foundations",
  "difficulty": "beginner",
  "estimated_hours": 30,
  "format": "course",
  "prerequisites": [],
  "tags": ["non-technical", "conceptual", "self-paced"],
  "description": "Foundational AI concepts...",
  "best_for": "Complete beginners, skeptics...",
  "last_verified": "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z",
  "status": "active"
}

6. Privacy & Statelessness
Principle: We don't keep your data because we don't need it.
NOT Stored:

No accounts, emails, responses, history

Stored:

directory.json (public data)
PDFs (24-hour TTL only)
Aggregate metrics (e.g., "347 briefings today")

Session Flow:

User arrives → ephemeral UUID
Vibe Check → held in Lambda memory
PDF → S3 with 24h TTL
Lambda terminates → data purged
After 24h → PDF deleted


7. Cost Controls (Voting Period: March 13-20)
Rate Limiting

API Gateway: 10 req/sec global
Lambda: 5-10 reserved concurrency
Bedrock: CloudWatch alarm on token spend
Budget alerts at $50/$100/$150

Front-Door Cap (Optional)

Track daily briefings
At 500/day → "At capacity, try tomorrow"


8. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
Frontend:

ARIA labels on all interactive elements
Full keyboard navigation
Screen reader tested
High contrast support
Text resize to 200%

PDF:

Semantic HTML headings
Descriptive link text
Alt text on icons

Testing: axe DevTools

9. Error Handling
Principle: Never show technical errors. Always friendly messages.

Bedrock timeout → "Took longer than expected. Let's retry."
No resources → "Trouble loading directory. Try again soon."
Rate limit → "High traffic! Refresh in a moment."
PDF fails → "Path ready below, but PDF didn't generate."


10. Testing
Unit Tests (pytest)

Coverage: 85% for agent logic
Mock all external services
Golden tests for Navigator consistency

Integration Tests

E2E: Vibe Check → PDF
Mocked Bedrock (Docker)
Verify clickable PDF links

Accessibility Tests

axe DevTools on all pages
Manual screen reader test
Keyboard-only navigation


11. Build Principles (SHARA)
S - Single Responsibility: One file, one job
H - Interface Contracts: Defined integration points
A - QA-First: Mocks before features
R - Security: Least-privilege, sanitization, no PII
A - Graceful Degradation: Friendly errors, not crashes
Logging:
pythonlogger.info("[agent:scout] Loaded %d resources", count)
logger.warning("[agent:navigator] Refinement cap hit")

12. Competition Narrative
For Judges:
"Clew Directive ships today as a focused tool for new AI learners. The architecture is domain-agnostic — we designed for expansion, shipped for impact."
Article Angle:

Kiro's spec-driven development + agent hooks enforced quality gates
Curator agent keeps directory honest automatically
WCAG 2.1 AA: Social impact without exclusion


13. Out of Scope (v1)
Will NOT Build:

Multi-domain (only "ai-foundations")
User accounts
Email delivery
Resource reviews
Mobile app
Non-English languages

Future:

Domain expansion (ai-security, ai-healthcare)
Progress tracking (requires accounts)
Community resource submission


Document Owner: Technical Lead
Status: Ready for Kiro implementation
