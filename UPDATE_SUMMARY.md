## Timeline Impact

**Previous Estimate** (with deferrals): ~40-56 hours remaining  
**Updated Estimate** (all phases active): ~40-56 hours remaining (no change)

**Why No Change?**
- These phases were always planned for pre-launch
- "Deferred" meant "after Phase 8B" not "after competition"
- Total work estimate remains the same

**Timeline**:
- Week 3 (Feb 26-Mar 4): Phases 8B, 7, 8C
- Week 4 (Mar 5-11): Phases 10, 10.5, 11-13
- **Launch**: March 12-13, 2026
